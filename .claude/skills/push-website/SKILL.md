# Publish the website

Shilpa is **not technical**. She just wants her changes to appear on her live website.
Do this whole flow yourself, in plain language, without asking her to run any commands.

## Steps

1. Make sure you are in the repo: `D:\code\letsattune\letsattune-website`.
2. See what changed: `git status --short`.
   - If **nothing** changed, tell her warmly: "There's nothing new to publish — your website is already up to date." Then stop.
3. Stage everything: `git add -A`.
4. Commit. Write a short, human commit message describing what changed in plain words
   (e.g. "Update workshop dates", "Change hero text", "Add new testimonial").
   - If you just made the edits this session, you already know what changed — use that.
   - If you're unsure what changed, glance at `git diff --stat` and summarise it. Don't ask her for a "commit message" — that's jargon.
   - End the commit message with:
     `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>`
5. Publish: `git push origin main`.
6. Confirm in plain language, e.g.:
   > ✅ Done! Your changes are saved and will appear on your website (letsattune.com) in about 30 seconds. Refresh the page after a minute to see them.

## Notes

- The git commands are pre-approved in `.claude/settings.json`, so they run without prompting her.
- If a command fails (e.g. no internet, or a push is rejected), explain the problem simply and
  what to do — never show raw error stack traces as the main message. Example:
  "It looks like your internet may be down — please reconnect and tell me to publish again."
- If the push is rejected because the remote is ahead, run `git pull --no-rebase origin main`
  first, then push again. If that produces a conflict, explain it plainly and stop — don't guess.
- Never use `--force` or destructive git commands here.
